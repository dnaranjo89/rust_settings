# Rust custom settings
## Changes in Settings
Experimental
- Optimez loading: Partial   # To load all the game assets quicker

Graphics:
  - Max shadow lights: 0  # To let light go through buildings
  - Object quality: 0 # See through welding in oil rig

User interface:
  - Hide text while in ads: ON  # To move and fade out text near the crosshair

Options:
 - Head bob: Off # To remove the slight bumping when running
 - Show blood: Off # To remove the blood from the screen when in slow health


## Changes in the terminal
In the game, press F1 and then introduce the following commands
```
# To remove leftovers after destroying buildings
effects.maxgibs -1

# To ease small jump-ups from floor to floor
input.autocrouch true

# To jump higher
physics.steps 60
physics.minsteps 60
```

And then add a couple of keybinds (find the keybind documentation [here](https://wiki.facepunch.com/rust/Keybinds))
```
# To zoom in while aiming
bind mouse1 +attack2;+fov 90;fov 70

# Run Garbage collector
bind j "gc.collect"

# Show outgoing combatlog (i.e only the damage youÂ´ve done)
bind f2 "consoletoggle;combatlog_outgoing"

# Quick kill
input.bind [leftshift+delete] kill

# Toggle min/max/default lookatradius
input.bind L ~meta.exec "client.lookatradius 0" "chat.add 0 0 MIN"; meta.exec "client.lookatradius 0.2" "chat.add 0 0 DEFAULT"; meta.exec "client.lookatradius 10" "chat.add 0 0 MAX"

# Use resources in inventory
input.bind 0 craft.add -97956382 1; craft.add 15388698 2; craft.add 1390353317 5
```
